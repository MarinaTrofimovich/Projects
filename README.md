# Description
The project solved the problem of predicting the churn of bank customers. Using the churned customers as a means of understanding why customers are leaving, we analyzed how and when churn occurs in a customer's life cycle with the bank and predicted the customer's churn. In the future the bank can use that information to put into place preemptive measures.
# Note
This project was completed under the Data Science course at ReDI School of Digital Integration (Munich).
